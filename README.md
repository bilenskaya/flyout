# Flyout

Work in progressâ€¦

demo: http://danielguillan.github.io/flyout/test/

## Goals
- Flexibility: left and right off-canvas navigation, no content or layout assumptions/requirements.
- Crossbrowser: all modern desktop and mobile browsers, IE8+, Android Browser 2.3, Opera Mobile.
- As little JS as possible. JS API: open(side), expand(side), close().
- High Performance.

## Dependencies
- Modernizr (for JS, css3dtransforms and overflow-scrolling detection)
- jQuery

## To-Do
- Browser testing
- Transitions in FF and Opera
- Better JS: vanilla JS? jQuery/Zepto plugin? Both?
